Large file transmission works. The bad news is when I used lnxsrv to try netem to try packet loss, it turns out something
is not supported by the version of glibc on lnxsrv. I'm guessing it's chrono, since every other library I'm pretty sure
I've used on lnxsrv before. When I wake up, I'm gonna rework it to use time.h instead of chrono.
